        Information technology is changing from only being tools for the
        researcher or the business professional to becoming part of our everyday
        lives.
        <br />The increasing physical presence of computers in various
        environments is often governed by the notion of invisible or
        disappearing computers. Look focuses on three levels of observation of
        technology: usability design, act of acceptance, presence in everyday
        life.
      </p>
      <p>- USABILITY</p>
      <p>
        We are used to evaluating a product, even in the field of computer
        technology, according to criteria that correspond to functional lines
        based on a general notion of use. Consequently, the code that the
        computer designer draws up meets the needs of a general user.
      </p>
      <p>- ACCEPTANCE</p>
      <p>
        A process of recognition needs to take place in the language that is
        proposed, and this process depends on experience.
      </p>
      <p>- PRESENCE</p>
      <p>
        The computer artefact enters the individualâ€™s experience through a
        filter that corresponds to a related and shared language and to which
        the user gives a precise and unique meaning. Look is designed to be an
        experiential site where the user gets in touch with the world of coding
        and is able to understand it in a simple and playful way, as opposed to
        how it is usually presented to viewers who have never approached coding.
      </p>
      <p>- CONCEPT</p>
      <p>
        What you see on these pages depends on a code you don't usually see,
        Look shows you the language of the designer who through narratives and
        metaphors makes technology understandable.<br />The code is invisible,
        but it exists, even if you take it for granted.
        <br />
        Look shows you the effort it would take to consult a computer artefact
        if there were no design mediation allowing us to see the code hidden
        behind our screens. Three elements, placed in a grid, reveal the
        computer code that generates them; these three elements at the same time
        pose issues and questions to the visitor to make him think about the
        presence of technology in our daily lives.The site uses eye tracking or
        mouse over technology to show what our designed layouts are hiding.
        Every time the visitor looks at one of the three boxes the code becomes
        visible and at the same time the eyes follow the movement of attention
        with the same technology.
